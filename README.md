# stock_analysis
Visualization and Analysis of stock market data in correlation with historic events.

There are 2 notebooks: data_generation.ipynb and data_analysis.ipynb

In order to run the contents of data_analysis, you will want to download the nasdaq_screener.csv file in this repository AND run the cells in data_generation.ipynb to create the other csv files necessary.

You may also need to install python packages like yfinance and mplfinance.

The large dataset will take 10-15 minutes to download and populate.

After the datafiles are all collected and packages installed, simply run all cells in data_analysis to view my visualizations and basic interpretations.
